Jonas system:

```css
/*
SPACING SYSTEM (px)
2 / 4 / 8 / 12 / 16 / 24 / 32 / 48 / 64 / 80 / 96 / 128

FONT SIZE SYSTEM (px)
10 / 12 / 14 / 16 / 18 / 20 / 24 / 30 / 36 / 44 / 52 / 62 / 74 / 86 / 98
*/
```

### Color

Colors convey meaning!

- OpenColor
- tailwindcss
- Flat UI Colors 2

- Main and Grey color
- Main, Accent and Grey color

(The grey color is usually just a very dark version of another color, like a dark blue)

Once you have your main and grey or main, accent and grey you need to choose: Tints and Shades.
