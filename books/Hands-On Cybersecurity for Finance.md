## Ch1. Introduction to Cybersecurity and the Economy

We're living in an era where specialists create built-to-sell malware to a waiting list of cyber criminals.

### What is cybersecurity? ‚Äì a brief technical description

According to Cisco cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks.

Cyber attacks are only becoming more effective and sophisticated. Cybersecurity is becoming a survival mechanism rather than a luxury.

Cybersecurity has multiple layers, which cover devices, networks, systems, and users.

In organizations, these layers can be compressed into three categories: people (), processes, and technology (devices, software).

### The scope of cybersecurity

There's a broad scope of what cybersecurity covers for both individuals and corporate organizations.

Critical infrastructure includes electricity grids, traffic lights, water supply systems, and even hospitals. Commonly-targeted sectors include transport, telecom, energy, and the industrial sector.

An irani nuclear facility was targeted by a malware called Stuxnet:

- Network security

Security companies are turning to new technologies, such as machine learning, to enable them to detect malicious and abnormal traffic in a more efficient and effective manner.

- Cloud security

Organizations and individuals are concerned about the theft of their cloud-stored data.

According to McAfee security, as many as one in every four organizations has been a victim of cloud data theft:

- Application/system security

A study showed that 100% of sampled web apps had at least one vulnerability:

App security is receiving attention in many organizations that have set up cybersecurity strategies.

- Internet of Things security

Cybersecurity has been extended to cover this threat landscape.

### Terminology related to the cybersecurity world

- Cybercrime
- Ransomware
- Malware
- Social engineering
- Phising
- Botnet: A network of 'hijacked' devices that act as bots controlled remotely to perform attacks [Mirai Botnet](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/mirai-botnet/)
- Data breach
- DDos attack
- Spyware

### General description of hacking groups, cyber criminals, and cyber espionage

Famous hacking groups:

- Shadow Brokers: Attacked the NSA, known for EternalBlue (2016).
- Bureau 121: From North Korea, Sony hack (2014).
- Anonymous

Cyber espionage (companies get their business secrets stolen) is becoming an economy menace since it affects the revenues of many organizations. Cyber espionage is carried out by hacking groups but can also be state-sponsored.

### Importance of cybersecurity and its impacts on the global economy

Yahoo lost its value after it was confirmed that cyber criminals had penetrated its systems and stolen the data of 3,000,000,000 users. Many other top companies have lost sensitive data to hackers. WannaCry ransomware indiscriminately encrypted individuals' and organizations' computers in over 150 countries.

In modern businesses, all the core aspects of a company's processes are handled using IT systems. When these systems are down, the company is seriously affected.

Without some critical components, such as ERP systems, networks, and computers, business operations can come to a halt.

Based on estimates from McAfee, it is expected that 2018 will see 0.8% of the global economy gross domestic product being lost to cybercrime.

Banking and financial systems have been the targets of cyber criminals. There are listings on some underground economies of **malware that can be used against automated teller machines to cause them to spit out cash.**

Black markets on the darknet are almost always the place where stolen data is sold. The buyers tend to either be advertisers or other cyber criminals.

### Financial repercussion of reputational damage caused by cyber attacks

Since Yahoo's cyber attack resulting in the theft of a whopping 3,000,000,000 accounts' data, the company significantly lost reputation and value. Verizon, the company that wanted to buy Yahoo, slashed $350 million from the amount that it had offered.
