The picture is way better than the above list.

Developers cannot expect to write code in isolation. Practice with others, whether virtually or in person. Look for moments to empathize, communicate, and collaborate with other people. You will see your skills develop through repetition and feedback.

How do you choose the right skills to learn?

Before you start spending time learning a recently released technology, evaluate why you want to learn that technology or skill. Does it align with your goals to advance your career to the next level?

Trying to learn everything can be overwhelming and can lead to procrastination and stagnation. Time is finite. It is our most precious and valuable commodity as humans.

# Part 1. The Basics: Learn and Practice the Technical Skills

## Ch1. The Secret to Learning about Technology Quickly and Continuously

How to stay up-to-date with the fast pace and changes of the technology world? The best solution is to **stop focusing on knowledge and start focusing on skills.**

- Trying to learn many things at once is confusing and you end up feeling tired and overwhelmed
- Forcing yourself to spend many hours a day doing something that seems never-ending is a recipe for frustration
- Learning many things that you will not apply right now is not only superficial but the knowledge will neither last nor will it be useful for long

When you learn a new skill, think about how you will apply that skill.

An effective way to think about knowledge is that it is a collection of memories that are disconnected from each other. Riding a bicycle is not knowledge; it‚Äôs a skill. Skills are like memories that are connected to each other. Once you recover one of those memories, they all come together and are accessed in a much faster way by your brain.

**Although you can acquire knowledge by reading or listening, you can only develop skills by doing.**

This is the same for every developer skill that you want to master. To really learn something, you must do things, instead of simply studying to acquire the knowledge.

Maryna Savchenko is a true believer in software craftsmanship, clean code, and TDD. She shared that what
really helped her in her learning journey is a book entitled A Mind for Numbers, by Barbara Oakley. By reading this book, she figured out her own "learning framework."

### Finding focus and priorities

_Which technologies are important to learn today, and which ones should we prioritize?_

**Choose to learn something that you need to apply right now.**

Do not focus on technologies, tools, frameworks or APIs. Focus on solving a particular problem, for example:

Focus on solving the very pressing problem of achieving high performance for large, scalable, Java-based finance applications in the cloud.

### Applying just-in-time learning

Step 1 ‚Äì Have a broad vision of the market
Step 2 ‚Äì Go deep when you are ready to apply

Have a broad view of the problem you are going after, the tools, technologies, companies, people, and more.

### Practicing deliberately to learn a technology

If you do want to be the best technical person you can be, then you must practice.

- You must practice with a specific purpose in mind. Define what you want to improve, by when, and what you are going to do to get there.
- Deliberate practice is focused: Choose a specific skill you want to improve and work deeply on it. Focus on the specific thing you need to improve and be better at. Practicing is improving one specific skill at a time.
- Deliberate practice is intense: Define some exercises that you can focus on with intensity for 30 minutes to 1 hour.
- Practice daily for short periods, not once a week for 5 hours.
- Use proven methods. Use code katas.

Consistency with a manageable amount of learning is the key to success in making learning a part of your lifestyle.
But, **to keep consistency, we need to build a few good habits.**

### Implementing important good habits

Steps to create good habits:

- Take action: Take small steps towards the goal. Overcome the inertia.
- Write every day: Speaking with someone or writing about it will help you clarify your thinking.
- Create routines to get yourself started
- Plan your week. The Three Big Rocks concept mentioned by Stephen Covey
- Deploy habits: experts say you need around 66 repetitions to create new pathways in the brain.

**Decide on your three big rocks for the week. Schedule time to do them. To choose the three big rocks, look at your long-term goals, and make sure you choose the things that move you in the right direction.**

Plan a week intelligently. Every sunday, review your week and block out time for priorities (the 3 big rocks), identify a list of tasks that should be accomplished in a week. Set habits that allow you to succeed. I.e., wake up early, set time early in the day for focus and creative stuff. Exercise. Fridays make time for new initiatives, networking, learning, etc.

Tips for learning new skills:

- Look for skills and knowledge you need to learn right now.
- Study and review the skills to build and deploy your habits.
- Have a plan and stick to it.
- Look for ways to celebrate and reward your success along the way.
- Get feedback and check your progress.
- Validate that you're on the right track. Adjust if necessary.

From the interview:

It‚Äôs extremely important to do deliberate practice in whatever skill you want to really build up.

It also gets easier when you start seeing results. When you start seeing results, that‚Äôs a boost for your motivation.

Focus not on the result but on the process, and just keep doing it.

## Ch2. Choose Your Best Path for Learning, Training and Certifications

- Approach every learning experience by first clarifying and understanding why you are investing your time and money
- Be clear about what you want your learning outcomes to be

Arguably, the most critical skill in software development is complex problem solving.

There are also ongoing formal training programs on topics like project management, technical leadership, or similar.

### Self-learning ‚Äì be independent by learning how to learn
